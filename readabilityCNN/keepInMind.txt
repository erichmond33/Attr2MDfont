***We need to think about our train/val/test split.
Right now we are using an 80/20 split of just train/val and test.
Maybe that is okay.

***Our readabilityCNN's inputs may have to be changed since we are doing concatenation anymore.
(This may be a problem when integrated with the GAN)

***In main.py on line 224 a weird concat happens to make the image sample.
We may have to do this before passing it into our CNN once we integrate it after training.

***We might want to change val_idx on line 234
