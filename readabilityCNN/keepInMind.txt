*** Do we want to change the learning rate or either betas for our optimizer?

***On second thought, the input to our readabilityCNN shouldn't be effected by their weird discriminator concat.
Our input shape should be (3, 64, 64) not their (6, 64, 64) from the concat.

***We need to think about our train/val/test split.
Right now we are using an 80/20 split of just train/val and test.
Maybe that is okay.

***Save image has nrows hardcoded in a couple of different places.
Might should keep an eye on that.

***Our readabilityCNN's inputs may have to be changed since we are doing concatenation anymore.
(This may be a problem when integrated with the GAN)

***In main.py on line 224 a weird concat happens to make the image sample.
We may have to do this before passing it into our CNN once we integrate it after training.

***We might want to change val_idx on line 234
